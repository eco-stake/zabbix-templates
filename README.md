# ECO Stake ðŸŒ± Zabbix Templates

These templates are from a Zabbix 5.0.6 installation. Each template is available as a named file in each subdirectory, or all can be imported at once using the [all-templates.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco-stake/zabbix-templates/master/all-templates.xml) file.

Each template is outlined below with the relevant items, triggers and graphs. Configuration is via Macros.
